        "# Documentation for Using the Script to Build AndroidAAPS\n",
        "\n",
        "This script is designed to help you build the AndroidAAPS application and save the built APK to your Google Drive. Please follow the instructions below to ensure a smooth process.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Running the Script\n",
        "\n",
        "To run the script, click on the top menu bar and select `Runtime`, then click on `Run all`. The script will start executing, and you will be prompted to follow the necessary steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Google Account and Google Drive Connection\n",
        "\n",
        "When you run this script, you will be prompted to log in with your Google Account. This is required for the script to access your Google Drive and save the built APK. Please follow the authentication steps to grant the necessary permissions for the script to connect to your Google Drive.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Default Save Locations\n",
        "\n",
        "By default, the script will save the built APK in the following directory in your Google Drive: `AAPS/releases/`\n",
        "\n",
        "The key will be saved at: `AAPS/key/key.jks`, and the key password will be saved at: `AAPS/key/key_password.txt`\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Using an Existing Key\n",
        "\n",
        "If you already have a key that you want to use for the build, you should place it at the following location in your Google Drive: `AAPS/key/key.jks`\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you can modify the `KEYSTORE_FILE` variable in the script to point to the location of your existing key file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, you will need to update the `KEY_PASSWORD` variable in the script with the password for your existing key.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please ensure that you've placed the key file in the correct location and updated the necessary variables before running the script to avoid errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Changing the Build Branch\n",
        "\n",
        "To build a different branch of the AndroidAAPS application, you can modify the value of the `AAPS_BRANCH` variable in the script. Set the variable to the desired branch name, and the script will build the application from that branch.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 6. Confirming Terms and Conditions\n",
        "\n",
        "Before the build process begins, you will be prompted to confirm that you have read and agreed to the Terms and Conditions. If you have read and agreed to the Terms and Conditions, type 'yes' and the build process will start.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Please be patient, as the script will take approximately 15 to 20 minutes to complete.**\n",
        "\n",
        "By following this documentation, you will be able to successfully build the AndroidAAPS application and save the APK to your Google Drive. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, please reach out for help."
